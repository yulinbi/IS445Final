So for the final project I am going to explore the income of employees in Illinois, while also considering the unemployment rate and income of some majors. I hope I can give you some help when choosing a major.</p><h2 id="unemployment-rate-in-different-majors">Unemployment rate in different majors</h2><pre><code>Firstly, let&#x27;s have a look on unemployment rate of different majors.</code></pre><p>This visualization is made by myself based on a dataset regarding to graduate student. It shows the unemployment rate in different majors and I give them a ranking. Actually, each major has more detailed directions. Because it is to make it easier to understand some of the final conclusions, I will not do too much analysis on the specific directions here.</p><div></div><pre><code>Data source:  https://data.world/fivethirtyeight/college-majors</code></pre><h2 id="top20-paid-bachelor-majors">Top<!-- -->2<!-- -->0 <!-- -->paid bachelor majors</h2><pre><code>Then, let&#x27;s see the 20 highest paid bachelor majors.</code></pre><img src="static/images/top20.png" idyll="[object Object]"/><pre><code>Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/633793/highest-paying-bachelor-degrees-in-the-us/</code></pre><p>We can see there are some overlapping majors from the above two visualizations, such as health, engineering, science, computer. So people who read this article they can choose these majors when attending university. Because after learning these majors, they may find job easier and get higher payment.</p><h2 id="illinois-payment">Illinois payment</h2><pre><code>Now! Welcome our main character.</code></pre><p>In this visualization, I give people three choice to select and explore each choice the rank of total salary in Illinois. When people select agency, they will find which agency pays employees more.  If they choose some of the better majors summarized before, they can go to these agencies to apply for their corresponding positions; when people select position title, they will find which position gets more payment. And they can combine this information and previous information to help them choose major to learn. As for selecting year, people can explore the salary is increasing in these years and they should be optimistic when they find jobs in the future because the salary will also increase.</p><select options="Agency,Position Title,Year"><option selected="" value="Agency">Agency</option><option value="Position Title">Position Title</option><option value="Year">Year</option></select><div></div><pre><code>Data source: https://data.illinois.gov/dataset/725state_employee_pay_hired_after_112011</code></pre><h2 id="ending">Ending</h2><p>So I wish you who is reading this article will find some conclusion or solution of selecting majors when attending University.</p></div></div></div></div>
